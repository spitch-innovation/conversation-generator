This is a call or conversation between a customer and a call center agent.
The call center is for a company, ACME e-commerce.  The customer is very
irate because an order they placed for a new microwave appears to have been
lost.  It was never delivered and the product, which was intended as a
birthday gift for the customer's mother in law, has not arrived.  The caller
is now in trouble with his wife and mother and law and is annoyed. They want
 a refund and an explanation.  The agent is experienced and does their best
 to fulfill the needs of the client. The conversation goes very poorly
 at the beginning despite the agent's best efforts.  But the agent manages
 to turn into a win at the end with help of their handling script (this
 last should not be explicit in the conversation, but obvious as a teachable
 moment to the manager/instructor reviewing it later.  The full conversation
 should be no more than 2 minutes long.
